- Missing corroboration for `hospital_diversion`: hospital-lane diversion — ask site about hospital stacklight/lane routing; check Hospital HMI and RMS fleet routing (optionally hospital DB models for L2).
- Missing corroboration for `lane_or_chute_state`: no linked runbook covers this capability; prefer catalog peers with matching capability_tags / expects_surface.

**Decision Outcomes:**

- `healthy` (observer=site_or_remote; tool=Hospital HMI / lane UI (operations + alarms)): Hospital station indicates ready/normal behavior and induct/add is not blocked.
- `unhealthy` (observer=site; tool=Hospital HMI / lane UI (operations + alarms)): Hospital station/service health problem suspected (shut down/not ready; induct/add blocked).
- `inconclusive` (observer=site_or_remote; tool=Hospital HMI / RMS fault context): Induct/add block not clearly attributable to station/service health from available screens.
- `escalate` (observer=site_or_remote; tool=Hospital HMI / RMS fault context): Evidence suggests non-station causes or telemetry gaps that prevent safe/accurate determination.

**Branches:**

- `unhealthy` → `node_2` when Hospital shutdown/not-ready + induct/add blocked
- `inconclusive` → `` when Induct issue isolated to tote/association mismatch (station appears ready)

##### Runbook: Check AUV/AGV overall fleet status using the “Overall System AGV Status” pop-up

- **Procedure ID:** `proc_check_auv_agv_overall_fleet_status_overall_system_agv_status_popup_v1`
- **Procedure Type:** `diagnostic`
- **Role:** `L1_support`
- **Audience:** `support`
- **Merge Status:** `pass_through`

**Summary:**
Use the RMS / fleet status UI pop-up titled “Overall System AGV Status” to confirm the current overall AGV/AUV system status is populated and capture the displayed overall status wording/values for troubleshooting context.

**When To Use:**
When you need a first confirmation of whether the overall AGV/AUV system status page is populated and what overall status it reports (e.g., to establish whether the system appears reachable vs overall-down/unreachable).

- **Source:** `training_video` / `training_video_day1`

**Procedure Steps:**

###### Step 1 — Open the RMS / fleet status UI and navigate to the “Overall System AGV Status” pop-up

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
In the RMS / fleet status UI (rms_ui), open the pop-up/page titled “Overall System AGV Status”.

**Healthy condition:**
The pop-up/page titled “Overall System AGV Status” is reachable and displayed.

**Expected result:**
The “Overall System AGV Status” pop-up/page is opened and visible.

---

###### Step 2 — Verify the “Overall System AGV Status” page is populated (not blank/unavailable)

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
On the “Overall System AGV Status” page, confirm the page shows current status details (i.e., the status content is present rather than blank/unreachable).

**Healthy condition:**
Status content is present on the “Overall System AGV Status” page (the page is not blank/unreachable).

**Expected result:**
The “Overall System AGV Status” page shows current overall AGV/AUV status details (not blank/unavailable).

---

###### Step 3 — Record the displayed overall status value(s) from the pop-up

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
Record the displayed overall status value(s) shown on the “Overall System AGV Status” page using the exact on-screen wording/fields present.

**Healthy condition:**
The recorded values match the on-screen overall status details currently shown on the page.

**Expected result:**
You have captured the displayed overall status value(s)/wording from the “Overall System AGV Status” pop-up.

---

**Success Criteria:**

- The “Overall System AGV Status” pop-up/page is reachable and populated with current status details.
- The displayed overall status value(s)/wording are recorded from the pop-up.

**Failure Conditions:**

- “Overall System AGV Status” pop-up/page is blank or unavailable (overall system-down/unreachable symptom).

<details><summary>Check Geek+ RMS overall page for system faults vs AGV system faults (and handle blank RMS due to firewall) (`proc_check_geek_rms_overall_system_faults_vs_agv_faults_v1`)</summary>

##### Runbook: Check Geek+ RMS overall page for system faults vs AGV system faults (and handle blank RMS due to firewall)

- **Procedure ID:** `proc_check_geek_rms_overall_system_faults_vs_agv_faults_v1`
- **Procedure Type:** `diagnostic`
- **Role:** `L1_support`
- **Audience:** `support`
- **Merge Status:** `pass_through`

**Summary:**
Use the Geek+ RMS / fleet status web UI to confirm the overall page is reachable and that it correctly separates fault categories: “system faults” on the left and “AGV system faults” on the right. If the RMS page is blank, treat it as a reachability/firewall symptom. Use the left/right placement to interpret whether the issue is communication loss vs an AGV that was commanded to move but is not in progress.

**When To Use:**
When you need to verify that the Geek+ RMS overall/fleet status page is reachable and that it is showing the expected fault panels (left system faults vs right AGV system faults), including the specific symptom where the page appears blank due to firewall not being open.

- **Source:** `training_video` / `training_video_day1`

**Procedure Steps:**

###### Step 1 — Open the Geek+ RMS / fleet status web UI (RMS overall page)

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
Open the Geek+ RMS / fleet status web UI (RMS / fleet status UI).

**Healthy condition:**
The RMS overall page is visible and fault panels can be observed.

**Expected result:**
The RMS overall page loads (or you observe that it is blank).

---

###### Step 2 — Confirm the RMS page is not blank; if blank, treat as firewall/reachability symptom

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
Check whether the RMS overall page shows content/fault panels. If it is blank, treat it as the firewall-not-open symptom described by the source.

**Healthy condition:**
Fault panels are visible (not blank).

**Expected result:**
Either (a) fault panels are visible, or (b) the page is blank consistent with firewall not being open.

---

###### Step 3 — Check left-side “system faults” panel

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
On the RMS overall page, check the left side labeled area for “system faults”.

**Healthy condition:**
The left “system faults” panel is visible (fault rows/entries can be observed if present).

**Expected result:**
The left-side “system faults” area is visible and can be reviewed for any listed faults.

---

###### Step 4 — Check right-side “AGV system faults” panel

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
On the RMS overall page, check the right side labeled area for “AGV system faults” (active AGV faults).

**Healthy condition:**
The right “AGV system faults” panel is visible (fault rows/entries can be observed if present).

**Expected result:**
The right-side “AGV system faults” area is visible and can be reviewed for any listed faults.

---

###### Step 5 — Interpret left/right fault placement for communication loss vs commanded-but-not-in-progress movement

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
Use the source mapping: if you lose communication with a chat, expect it on the left “system faults”; if you told an AGV to move but it hasn’t moved, expect it on the right “AGV system faults”.

**Healthy condition:**
Observed faults align with the expected left/right meaning (left = communication loss; right = commanded move not in progress).

**Expected result:**
You can map the observed fault placement to either communication-loss (left) or commanded-but-not-in-progress movement (right).

---

**Success Criteria:**

- RMS overall page is reachable and not blank (fault panels visible).
- Left “system faults” and right “AGV system faults” areas are observable on the RMS overall page.
- Observed fault placement can be interpreted as communication loss (left) vs commanded-but-not-in-progress movement (right) using the source mapping.

**Failure Conditions:**

- RMS remains blank (no visible system/AGV fault panels).
- Left/right fault separation is not observable or does not align with the expected meaning (left = communication loss; right = commanded move not in progress).
