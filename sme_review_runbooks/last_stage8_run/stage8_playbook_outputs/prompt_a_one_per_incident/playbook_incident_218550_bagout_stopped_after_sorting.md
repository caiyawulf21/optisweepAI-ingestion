| Confidence | `medium` |
| Validation Status | `needs_sme_review` |

## Entry Symptoms

- System stops at bag-out after sorting
- Manual bagging out is required
- An AGV appears not to move for an extended period (e.g., hours)
- Hospital-area HMI shows a fault
- Site suspects a robot/AGV is out of sequence or task/exchange is not progressing

## Affected Systems

- bag-out stage
- AGV / robots
- RMS (fleet status UI)
- Hospital HMI / lane UI (hospital-area screen referenced in chat)
- Aveva screen visibility context (mentioned as not viewable during troubleshooting)
- System active error (referenced as a diagnostic check)

## Nodes

### 1 — Confirm bag-out stall pattern and identify whether an AGV/robot/exchange pair is stuck (`diagnostic_decision`)

**Intent:** Determine whether the reported bag-out stoppage is currently associated with an abnormal AGV/robot inactivity or active error condition and whether hospital HMI fault state is present.

**Expects capability:** agv_active_errors
**Expects surface:** rms_ui, wcs_sql
**Preferred audience:** operator, L2_support

**Runbook Links:**

- `proc_check_overall_system_agv_status_popup_agv_destination_errors_v1` (medium, support, score=0.8486, boosted=1.0) — Check Overall System AGV Status popup for AGVs with destination errors
  - gaps: Limited domain-term overlap between placeholder and runbook.; Placeholder wording differs materially from matched runbook title.
- `proc_check_overall_system_faults_and_active_agv_faults_overall_system_rms_v1` (high, support, score=0.8633, boosted=1.0) — Check Overall System Faults and Active AGV Faults on the Overall System RMS Page
  - gaps: Limited domain-term overlap between placeholder and runbook.; Placeholder wording differs materially from matched runbook title.
- `proc_query_active_agv_errors_from_the_wcs_database_v1` (high, support, score=0.3, boosted=1.21) — Query Active AGV Errors From the WCS Database
  - gaps: Retrieval score 0.3000 below medium threshold.; Limited domain-term overlap between placeholder and runbook.; Placeholder wording differs materially from matched runbook title.

**Decision Outcomes:**

- `healthy` (observer=remote; tool=WCS/SSMS (read-only) | Hospital HMI): RMS/WCS evidence confirms no blocking abnormal AGV inactivity/active errors matching the bag-out stall, and hospital HMI fault is not present or is in a cleared/acknowledge-ready state; bag-out pattern is not actively stalled.
- `unhealthy` (observer=site_or_remote; tool=WCS/SSMS (read-only) | Hospital HMI): RMS/WCS evidence shows abnormal AGV inactivity and/or active AGV/system errors that correlate with the bag-out stall, and hospital HMI fault state is present and/or bag-out remains stuck in request.
- `inconclusive` (observer=remote; tool=WCS/SSMS (read-only) | Hospital HMI): Evidence cannot be reliably corroborated (e.g., hospital HMI/AVEVA screen visibility limits) and WCS/RMS evidence is missing, blank, or not correlatable to the stall window.
- `escalate` (observer=remote; tool=WCS/SSMS (read-only) | Hospital HMI): Even after initial diagnostic checks, active fault correlation remains unverified and the pattern still cannot be matched to an actionable recovery approach safely within this template.

**Branches:**

- `unhealthy` → `node_2` when Corroborated stall: abnormal AGV inactivity/active errors + hospital HMI fault
- `inconclusive` → `` when No corroboration / pattern not matched

##### Runbook: Check Overall System AGV Status popup for AGVs with destination errors

- **Procedure ID:** `proc_check_overall_system_agv_status_popup_agv_destination_errors_v1`
- **Procedure Type:** `diagnostic`
- **Role:** `L1_support`
- **Audience:** `support`
- **Merge Status:** `pass_through`

**Summary:**
Use the live RMS / fleet status UI popup titled “Overall System AGV Status” to identify which AGVs currently have errors and review their Destination and Errors details. The popup shows a top section for all AGVs and a bottom section filtered to only AGVs with errors.

**When To Use:**
When you need to quickly determine which AGVs have active errors related to destination/error conditions and view their Destination and Errors details in the RMS fleet status UI.

- **Source:** `training_video` / `training_video_day1`

**Procedure Steps:**

###### Step 1 — Open the RMS “Overall System AGV Status” popup

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
In the RMS / fleet status UI (rms_ui), navigate to the popup/screen titled “Overall System AGV Status”.

**Healthy condition:**
The popup title “Overall System AGV Status” is visible and the popup is rendered with both top and bottom sections.

**Expected result:**
The “Overall System AGV Status” popup is displayed.

---

###### Step 2 — Confirm top section fields for all AGVs (ID, Status, Destination, Errors)

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
In the “Overall System AGV Status” popup, check the top section table/list to confirm it includes fields/columns for ID, Status, Destination, and Errors.

**Healthy condition:**
The top section shows a detailed table/list for all AGVs with visible column headers/fields: ID, Status, Destination, Errors.

**Expected result:**
The top section displays the fields/columns “ID”, “Status”, “Destination”, and “Errors”.

---

###### Step 3 — Confirm bottom section is filtered to AGVs with errors

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
In the “Overall System AGV Status” popup, check the bottom section to confirm it lists only AGVs with errors and includes additional error/destination detail for those AGVs.

**Healthy condition:**
The bottom section contains only error AGVs and additional detail is present for those error cases.

**Expected result:**
The bottom section lists only AGVs with errors (error cases) and shows additional detail for those error AGVs.

---

###### Step 4 — Record AGV IDs and their Destination/Errors from the error-only bottom section

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
For each AGV listed in the bottom (error-only) section, record/verify the AGV ID and the associated Destination and Errors details displayed in the popup.

**Healthy condition:**
Each bottom-section row corresponds to an error case and includes the AGV ID plus Destination and Errors details.

**Expected result:**
You have a list of AGV IDs from the bottom section along with their displayed Destination and Errors values.

---

###### Step 5 — Escalate if popup fields are missing or error-only list behavior is inconsistent

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
If the popup does not show the expected “Overall System AGV Status” title/fields (ID, Status, Destination, Errors) or if the bottom section does not correctly show only AGVs with errors, stop and escalate.

**Healthy condition:**
No escalation is required because the popup title/fields are present and the bottom section correctly reflects error-only AGVs.

**Expected result:**
Escalation is initiated when UI evidence is inconsistent with expected fields or filtering behavior.

---

**Success Criteria:**

- The “Overall System AGV Status” popup displays the expected fields: ID, Status, Destination, Errors in the top section.
- The bottom section lists only AGVs with errors and shows additional detail for those error AGVs.
- For each AGV in the bottom (error-only) section, the AGV ID and its Destination and Errors values are captured.

**Failure Conditions:**

- Popup fails to display expected fields (ID/Status/Destination/Errors).
- Bottom section is empty while the top section indicates any AGV has a non-empty Errors value.
- Bottom section does not behave as an error-only list.

---

###### Step 2 — Check the left-side “system faults” area

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
On the Overall System RMS page, look at the left-side “system faults” area and determine whether any system faults are listed/present.

**Healthy condition:**
The left-side “system faults” area shows no system faults (empty/not showing faults).

**Expected result:**
You can state whether the left-side “system faults” area shows one or more fault entries or is empty/not showing faults at the time of the check.

---

###### Step 3 — Check the right-side “active AGV faults” area

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
On the same Overall System RMS page, look at the right-side “active AGV faults” area and determine whether any active AGV faults are listed/present.

**Healthy condition:**
The right-side “active AGV faults” area shows no active AGV faults (empty/not showing faults).

**Expected result:**
You can state whether the right-side “active AGV faults” area shows one or more fault entries or is empty/not showing faults at the time of the check.

---

###### Step 4 — Report the displayed fault indications (or confirm none are displayed)

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
If the left “system faults” area and/or the right “active AGV faults” area shows entries, report those fault indications to support. If both areas are empty/not showing faults, report that no system faults/active AGV faults are currently displayed on this page.

**Healthy condition:**
Report indicates both sides show no fault entries (no system faults and no active AGV faults displayed).

**Expected result:**
A clear statement is provided indicating whether system faults are present on the left and whether active AGV faults are present on the right at the time of the check.

---

**Success Criteria:**

- You verify the presence/absence of system faults in the left-side “system faults” area on the Overall System RMS page.
- You verify the presence/absence of active AGV faults in the right-side “active AGV faults” area on the Overall System RMS page.

### 2 — Apply approved sequence/pair stabilization actions to restart bag-out (`procedure_reference`)

**Intent:** If the stall correlates with an abnormal AGV/robot/exchange-pair condition, perform the approved stabilization actions that restore proper sequencing so bag-out can progress automatically.

**Expects capability:** agv_active_errors
**Expects surface:** hospital_hmi, rms_ui
**Preferred audience:** L2_support, operator

**Runbook Links:**

- `proc_check_overall_system_agv_status_popup_agv_destination_errors_v1` (medium, support, score=0.7346, boosted=1.0) — Check Overall System AGV Status popup for AGVs with destination errors
  - gaps: Limited domain-term overlap between placeholder and runbook.; Placeholder wording differs materially from matched runbook title.

**Decision Outcomes:**

- `healthy` (observer=site_or_remote; tool=RMS / AGV status UI | Hospital HMI): Stabilization actions restore sequence/pair alignment and bag-out transitions from the prior stalled/request state into active bag-out, continuing beyond the prior stop point.
- `unhealthy` (observer=site_or_remote; tool=RMS / AGV status UI | Hospital HMI | WCS/SSMS (read-only)): Recovery actions do not resolve the stall: bag-out starts then stops again with the same symptoms; abnormal inactivity/active errors persist; hospital fault persists post-ack/retry.
- `inconclusive` (observer=remote; tool=RMS / AGV status UI | Hospital HMI): Stabilization actions were applied but evidence of effect is unclear due to limited observability (e.g., screens not viewable) or time correlation is ambiguous.
- `escalate` (observer=remote; tool=WCS/SSMS (read-only) | Hospital HMI | RMS / AGV status UI): Bag-out cannot progress after sequence/pair stabilization and HMI acknowledgement/retry, with continued blocking active AGV/system errors or un-clearable hospital HMI fault.

**Branches:**

- `healthy` → `node_3` when Recovery actions completed and bag-out resumes beyond the prior stop point; hospital HMI fault is acknowledged/cleared and RMS/WCS no longer shows the blocking abnormal condition
- `unhealthy` → `` when Bag-out still stalls (starts then stops again) or abnormal AGV inactivity/active errors persist, or hospital HMI fault persists after acknowledgement/retry

- **Procedure Type:** `diagnostic`
- **Role:** `L1_support`
- **Audience:** `support`
- **Merge Status:** `pass_through`

**Summary:**
Use the live RMS / fleet status UI popup titled “Overall System AGV Status” to identify which AGVs currently have errors and review their Destination and Errors details. The popup shows a top section for all AGVs and a bottom section filtered to only AGVs with errors.

**When To Use:**
When you need to quickly determine which AGVs have active errors related to destination/error conditions and view their Destination and Errors details in the RMS fleet status UI.

- **Source:** `training_video` / `training_video_day1`

**Procedure Steps:**

###### Step 1 — Open the RMS “Overall System AGV Status” popup

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
In the RMS / fleet status UI (rms_ui), navigate to the popup/screen titled “Overall System AGV Status”.

**Healthy condition:**
The popup title “Overall System AGV Status” is visible and the popup is rendered with both top and bottom sections.

**Expected result:**
The “Overall System AGV Status” popup is displayed.

---

###### Step 2 — Confirm top section fields for all AGVs (ID, Status, Destination, Errors)

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
In the “Overall System AGV Status” popup, check the top section table/list to confirm it includes fields/columns for ID, Status, Destination, and Errors.

**Healthy condition:**
The top section shows a detailed table/list for all AGVs with visible column headers/fields: ID, Status, Destination, Errors.

**Expected result:**
The top section displays the fields/columns “ID”, “Status”, “Destination”, and “Errors”.

---

###### Step 3 — Confirm bottom section is filtered to AGVs with errors

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
In the “Overall System AGV Status” popup, check the bottom section to confirm it lists only AGVs with errors and includes additional error/destination detail for those AGVs.

**Healthy condition:**
The bottom section contains only error AGVs and additional detail is present for those error cases.

**Expected result:**
The bottom section lists only AGVs with errors (error cases) and shows additional detail for those error AGVs.

---

###### Step 4 — Record AGV IDs and their Destination/Errors from the error-only bottom section

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
For each AGV listed in the bottom (error-only) section, record/verify the AGV ID and the associated Destination and Errors details displayed in the popup.

**Healthy condition:**
Each bottom-section row corresponds to an error case and includes the AGV ID plus Destination and Errors details.

**Expected result:**
You have a list of AGV IDs from the bottom section along with their displayed Destination and Errors values.

---

###### Step 5 — Escalate if popup fields are missing or error-only list behavior is inconsistent

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
If the popup does not show the expected “Overall System AGV Status” title/fields (ID, Status, Destination, Errors) or if the bottom section does not correctly show only AGVs with errors, stop and escalate.

**Healthy condition:**
No escalation is required because the popup title/fields are present and the bottom section correctly reflects error-only AGVs.

**Expected result:**
Escalation is initiated when UI evidence is inconsistent with expected fields or filtering behavior.

---

**Success Criteria:**

- The “Overall System AGV Status” popup displays the expected fields: ID, Status, Destination, Errors in the top section.
- The bottom section lists only AGVs with errors and shows additional detail for those error AGVs.
- For each AGV in the bottom (error-only) section, the AGV ID and its Destination and Errors values are captured.

**Failure Conditions:**

- Popup fails to display expected fields (ID/Status/Destination/Errors).
- Bottom section is empty while the top section indicates any AGV has a non-empty Errors value.
- Bottom section does not behave as an error-only list.

**Catalog Gaps:**

- Wrong catalog family: hospital HMI/stacklight does not corroborate RMS roster/mapping (use RMS map/roster views; hospital UI is secondary diversion corroboration only).

**Decision Outcomes:**

- `healthy` (observer=site_or_remote; tool=RMS / AGV status UI | Hospital HMI | WCS/SSMS (read-only)): Bag-out completes successfully and does not revert to the prior request/stall behavior; abnormal AGV inactivity/active errors are cleared; hospital HMI fault acknowledgement/retry resulted in a normal state.
- `unhealthy` (observer=site_or_remote; tool=RMS / AGV status UI | WCS/SSMS (read-only) | Hospital HMI): Bag-out remains stalled or stops again; RMS/WCS continues showing blocking abnormal AGV inactivity/active errors; hospital HMI fault persists after acknowledgement/retry.
- `inconclusive` (observer=remote; tool=RMS / AGV status UI | Hospital HMI | WCS/SSMS (read-only)): Validation is inconclusive due to limited observability (e.g., unreadable screens or missing evidence windows).
- `escalate` (observer=remote; tool=WCS/SSMS (read-only) | Hospital HMI | RMS / AGV status UI): After attempted stabilization and acknowledgement/retry, bag-out still cannot progress and blocking active AGV/system errors or an un-clearable hospital HMI fault persist. Escalate with an evidence package.

**Summary:**
Use the hospital station stacklight color and flashing pattern to determine the current station condition: Default/Indeterminate, No AGV present, RMS error, Fault, or AGV present (flashing yellow for 15 seconds).

**When To Use:**
When you need to identify the current hospital station condition by observing the station stacklight (solid vs flashing colors).

- **Source:** `manual` / `manual_optisweep_om_v3`

**Procedure Steps:**

###### Step 1 — Locate the hospital station stacklight

**Responsible role:** operator

**Instruction:**
Locate the hospital station’s stacklight (each hospital station has one stacklight).

**Healthy condition:**
The correct stacklight for the hospital station is visible and observable.

**Expected result:**
You can visually see the hospital station stacklight that illuminates in sections.

---

###### Step 2 — Observe whether the stacklight is solid or flashing

**Responsible role:** operator

**Instruction:**
Observe the stacklight indication and note whether it is solid or flashing.

**Healthy condition:**
Stacklight colors and solid/flashing behavior are clearly observable.

**Expected result:**
You have identified the stacklight pattern as solid or flashing (and which colors are lit).

---

###### Step 3 — Map Solid Red to Default/Indeterminate

**Responsible role:** operator

**Instruction:**
If the stacklight is Solid Red, record the state as Default/Indeterminate.

**Healthy condition:**
Solid Red is observed and the recorded state matches Default/Indeterminate.

**Expected result:**
Recorded station condition = Default/Indeterminate when Solid Red is observed.

---

###### Step 4 — Map Solid Green to No AGV present

**Responsible role:** operator

**Instruction:**
If the stacklight is Solid Green, record the state as No AGV present at the station.

**Healthy condition:**
Solid Green is observed and the recorded state matches No AGV present at the station.

**Expected result:**
Recorded station condition = No AGV present at the station when Solid Green is observed.

---

###### Step 5 — Map Red+Yellow+Green to RMS error

**Responsible role:** operator

**Instruction:**
If the stacklight shows Red, Yellow, and Green simultaneously, record the state as RMS error.

**Healthy condition:**
Red, Yellow, and Green are simultaneously observed and the recorded state matches RMS error.

**Expected result:**
Recorded station condition = RMS error when Red+Yellow+Green are simultaneously lit.

---

###### Step 6 — Map Flashing Red to Fault

**Responsible role:** operator

**Instruction:**
If the stacklight is Flashing Red, record the state as Fault.

**Healthy condition:**
Flashing Red is observed and the recorded state matches Fault.

**Expected result:**
Recorded station condition = Fault when Flashing Red is observed.

---

###### Step 7 — Map Flashing Yellow (15 seconds) to AGV present

**Responsible role:** operator

**Instruction:**
If the stacklight is Flashing Yellow, confirm it lasts for 15 seconds, then record the state as AGV is present at either position of the station.

**Healthy condition:**
Flashing Yellow is observed and lasts for 15 seconds; recorded state matches AGV present at either position.

**Expected result:**
Recorded station condition = AGV is present at either position of the station when Flashing Yellow persists for 15 seconds.

---

**Success Criteria:**

- Operator maps the observed hospital station stacklight solid/flashing color pattern to exactly one documented station condition: Default/Indeterminate, No AGV present, RMS error, Fault, or AGV present (15-second Flashing Yellow).

**Failure Conditions:**

- Observed stacklight pattern does not match any documented state (Solid Red, Solid Green, Red+Yellow+Green, Flashing Red, Flashing Yellow for 15 seconds).
- Flashing Yellow is observed but duration is not confirmed as 15 seconds before recording AGV present.

##### Runbook: Check Overall System AGV Status popup for AGVs with destination errors

- **Procedure ID:** `proc_check_overall_system_agv_status_popup_agv_destination_errors_v1`
- **Procedure Type:** `diagnostic`
- **Role:** `L1_support`
- **Audience:** `support`
- **Merge Status:** `pass_through`

**Summary:**
Use the live RMS / fleet status UI popup titled “Overall System AGV Status” to identify which AGVs currently have errors and review their Destination and Errors details. The popup shows a top section for all AGVs and a bottom section filtered to only AGVs with errors.

**When To Use:**
When you need to quickly determine which AGVs have active errors related to destination/error conditions and view their Destination and Errors details in the RMS fleet status UI.

- **Source:** `training_video` / `training_video_day1`

**Procedure Steps:**

###### Step 1 — Open the RMS “Overall System AGV Status” popup

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
In the RMS / fleet status UI (rms_ui), navigate to the popup/screen titled “Overall System AGV Status”.

**Healthy condition:**
The popup title “Overall System AGV Status” is visible and the popup is rendered with both top and bottom sections.

**Expected result:**
The “Overall System AGV Status” popup is displayed.

---

###### Step 2 — Confirm top section fields for all AGVs (ID, Status, Destination, Errors)

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
In the “Overall System AGV Status” popup, check the top section table/list to confirm it includes fields/columns for ID, Status, Destination, and Errors.

**Healthy condition:**
The top section shows a detailed table/list for all AGVs with visible column headers/fields: ID, Status, Destination, Errors.

**Expected result:**
The top section displays the fields/columns “ID”, “Status”, “Destination”, and “Errors”.

---

###### Step 3 — Confirm bottom section is filtered to AGVs with errors

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
In the “Overall System AGV Status” popup, check the bottom section to confirm it lists only AGVs with errors and includes additional error/destination detail for those AGVs.

**Healthy condition:**
The bottom section contains only error AGVs and additional detail is present for those error cases.

**Expected result:**
The bottom section lists only AGVs with errors (error cases) and shows additional detail for those error AGVs.

---

###### Step 4 — Record AGV IDs and their Destination/Errors from the error-only bottom section

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
For each AGV listed in the bottom (error-only) section, record/verify the AGV ID and the associated Destination and Errors details displayed in the popup.

**Healthy condition:**
Each bottom-section row corresponds to an error case and includes the AGV ID plus Destination and Errors details.

**Expected result:**
You have a list of AGV IDs from the bottom section along with their displayed Destination and Errors values.

---

###### Step 5 — Escalate if popup fields are missing or error-only list behavior is inconsistent

**Responsible role:** L1_support

**Instruction:**
If the popup does not show the expected “Overall System AGV Status” title/fields (ID, Status, Destination, Errors) or if the bottom section does not correctly show only AGVs with errors, stop and escalate.

**Healthy condition:**
No escalation is required because the popup title/fields are present and the bottom section correctly reflects error-only AGVs.

**Expected result:**
Escalation is initiated when UI evidence is inconsistent with expected fields or filtering behavior.

---

**Success Criteria:**

- The “Overall System AGV Status” popup displays the expected fields: ID, Status, Destination, Errors in the top section.
- The bottom section lists only AGVs with errors and shows additional detail for those error AGVs.
- For each AGV in the bottom (error-only) section, the AGV ID and its Destination and Errors values are captured.

**Failure Conditions:**

- Popup fails to display expected fields (ID/Status/Destination/Errors).
- Bottom section is empty while the top section indicates any AGV has a non-empty Errors value.
- Bottom section does not behave as an error-only list.
