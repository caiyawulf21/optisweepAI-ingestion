# Development Log

## Unreleased

### Added
- Stage 1 source bundle extraction for the OptiSweep Operation and Maintenance Manual.
- Stage 2 source artifact and image extraction with artifact reports and priority figure checks.
- Stage 3 Azure AI Foundry source artifact enrichment with descriptions, tags, what-to-look-at guidance, and retrieval text.
- Stage 4 operational context extraction scaffolding for reusable context records.

### Changed
- README current-stage guidance now reflects the implemented ingestion stages.

### Decisions
- Keep this repo focused on local ingestion and data quality before database writes.
- Use one future LangGraph pipeline with multiple stage nodes.
- Keep source artifact enrichment separate from operational context, runbooks, workflows, and relationship linking.
